# Exercise 1-1
# 1/1 point (graded)
# Suppose we have an experiment. We toss a coin  times. Each time we collect results from a sample of size  and compute this sample's mean  and standard deviation . This experiment has an underlying distribution with mean  and standard deviation .
# 
# Which of the following does the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) guarantee (for large enough  and ):
# 
# 
# The sample means will be approximately normally distributed. correct
# The sample means will have a mean close to the mean of the original distribution . correct
# The sample means will have a variance close to the variance of the original distribution divided by the sample size . correct
# correct
# Submit
